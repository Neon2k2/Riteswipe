# RiteSwipe Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the disaster recovery (DR) strategy for RiteSwipe, ensuring business continuity in case of regional outages or other disasters.

## Architecture

### Primary Region (East US)
- App Service (API)
- SQL Server (Primary)
- Redis Cache
- Storage Account
- Key Vault

### Secondary Region (West US)
- App Service (DR)
- SQL Server (Secondary)
- Redis Cache (DR)
- Recovery Services Vault
- Automation Account

## Components

### 1. Traffic Manager
- Global load balancer for routing traffic
- Health monitoring every 30 seconds
- Automatic failover when primary region is unhealthy
- 60-second DNS TTL for quick failover

### 2. SQL Database Geo-Replication
- Asynchronous replication to secondary region
- Automatic failover group
- Read-only access to secondary database
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): < 5 minutes
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): < 30 minutes

### 3. Redis Cache
- Separate Redis instances in each region
- Data synchronization through application layer
- Cache warming process after failover

### 4. Recovery Services Vault
- Cross-region backup storage
- 24-hour recovery point retention
- 4-hour application consistent snapshots
- Automated recovery procedures

## Failover Procedures

### Automatic Failover
1. Traffic Manager detects primary endpoint failure
2. Traffic automatically routes to secondary region
3. Secondary database promotes to primary
4. Redis cache starts serving requests
5. Monitoring alerts notify operations team

### Manual Failover
1. Run failover automation runbook
2. Verify database promotion
3. Update application configuration
4. Validate system functionality
5. Monitor performance metrics

## Recovery Procedures

### Post-Failover
1. Investigate root cause
2. Repair primary region issues
3. Re-establish replication
4. Verify data consistency
5. Plan failback operation

### Failback
1. Verify primary region health
2. Synchronize data to primary
3. Update Traffic Manager priorities
4. Monitor application performance
5. Verify system functionality

## Testing Schedule

### Monthly Tests
- Failover runbook execution
- Database promotion verification
- Application functionality validation
- Performance baseline comparison

### Quarterly Tests
- Full region failover
- Data consistency verification
- Recovery time measurement
- Process documentation update

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Health Metrics
- Endpoint response times
- Database replication lag
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates

### Alert Thresholds
- Response time > 1 second
- Replication lag > 10 minutes
- Error rate > 1%
- Cache miss rate > 20%
